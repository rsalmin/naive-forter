# Naive Forther

 Toy Forth Interpreter, writed along the reading of [Starting Forth](https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/), it reflects my current understanding of Forth, and subject to change. Despite that it planed to be fully functional for executing of all examples in the book up to the point of my reading (probably with some exceptions).

 Now I am at the end of Chapter 1. All works, except loop, which is will be implemented in Chapter 6.
