# Naive Forther

 Toy Forth Interpreter, is written along the lines of [Starting Forth](https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/), it reflects my current understanding of Forth, and it is subject to change. Despite that, Naive Forther is planned to be fully functional for executing of all examples from the book up to the point of my reading (probably with some exceptions).


 In Chapter 1. All works, except loop, will be implemented in Chapter 6.

 Now I passed Arithmetics in Chapter 2.
